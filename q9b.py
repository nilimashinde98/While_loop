# Make an algorithm that takes 2 numbers as inputs from the user. Then we will multiply 
# those numbers and print the result. Example :-, if we input 5 and 4 then 20 should be printed.
# Note :-
# Don't use * multiply operator to multiply , you can use any other operators like +,-).


# i=1
# multi=0
# while i<=2:
#     user=int(input("enter your number"))
#     # user=user+i
#     multi=user+user
#     print(multi)
#     i=i+1


num1=int(input("Enter the First numbers :"))
num2=int(input("Enter the Second number:"))
sum=1
while sum<=2:
    sum=num1+1
    sum=sum+num2
print("The multiplication of ",num1," and ",num2," is ",sum)
